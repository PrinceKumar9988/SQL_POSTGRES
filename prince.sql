-- JOINS


-- JOINS:- TO APPLY JOINS, THERE SHOULD BE A COMMON ATTRIBUTE BETWEEN TWO TABLES(FOREIGN KEY)

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);
INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName) VALUES
(101, 'HR'),
(102, 'IT'),
(104, 'Finance'),
(105, 'FinCORP'),
(106, 'ACCOUNTS'),
(108, 'Devloper');








CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);


INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID) VALUES
(1, 'John', 101),
(2, 'Alice', 102),
(3, 'Bob', 104),
(4, 'Eve', 102);

SELECT * FROM Departments ;
SELECT * FROM Employees;




-- INNER JOIN

SELECT C.*, O.* FROM Departments AS C INNER JOIN Employees AS O ON C.DepartmentID=O.DepartmentID;

-- OUTER JOIN:-
   -- LEFT JOIN

      SELECT C.*, O.* FROM Departments AS C LEFT JOIN Employees AS O ON C.DepartmentID=O.DepartmentID;

   -- RIGHT JOIN:-

      SELECT C.*, O.* FROM Departments AS C RIGHT JOIN Employees AS O ON C.DepartmentID=O.DepartmentID;

   -- FULL JOIN:- 

       SELECT C.*, O.* FROM Departments AS C FULL JOIN Employees AS O ON C.DepartmentID=O.DepartmentID; -- In postgresql we have FULL JOIN as a keyword that we can use to write sql query but in mysql we have to do union of LEFT JOIN AND RIGHT JOIN. 
	   

-- CROSS JOIN:- It is basically cartesian product of both the tables.
-- If left table has m rows and right table has n rows then resultant table will have m*n rows.

       SELECT C.* , O.* FROM Departments AS C CROSS JOIN Employees AS O;



-- SELF JOIN:-(v.imp look at the ss(Notes))
-- self join can be done with the help of the inner join or left join


-- Employee manager relationship
SELECT e1.EmployeeID AS Employee, e1.Name AS EmployeeName, 
       e2.EmployeeID AS ManagerID, e2.Name AS ManagerName
FROM Employees e1
LEFT JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;    -- important to understand after ON

--or 

SELECT e1.EmployeeID, e1.Name AS Employee, e2.Name AS Manager
FROM Employees e1
INNER JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;


-- SET OPERATIONS:-

-- üìå Is it Important to Have the Same Columns in Set Operations (UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS)?
-- Yes! In SQL, when performing set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, and MINUS (also called EXCEPT in PostgreSQL and MySQL), both tables must have:

-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ The same number of columns
-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ The same data types in corresponding columns
-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Compatible column order

-- No duplicates are allowed in sets

-- There r 3 types of SET operations:-

-- UNION
-- INTERSECTION
-- MINUS

-- UNION:-

-- UNION SEEMS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE FULL JOIN(VENN DIAGRAM)

-- INTERSECT:-

-- INTERSECT SEEMS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE INNER JOIN(VENN DIAGRAM)


SELECT * FROM Employees_2023
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM Employees_2024;
-- IN POSTGRES SQL WE HAVE INTERSECT AS A KEYWORD BUT IN MYSQL WE DO IT USING INNER JOIN(NOTES).


-- MINUS:-

-- THERE IS NO MINUS IN POSTGRES SQL SO WE HAVE TO DO IT USING LEFT JOIN.

SELECT * FROM Employees_2023 AS A EXCEPT SELECT * FROM Employees_2024;  -- EXCEPT IS USED IN POSTGRES TO MINUS
